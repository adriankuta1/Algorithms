# Algorithms
Hi all,

I'm using this repository to hold examples of different algorithms that I have coded myself. Some may not be the prettiest or most efficient, but they have been effective on my small scale test sets. I welcome any comments to draw my attention to issues or inefficiencies in the code, and am especially happy to recieve and constructive feedback!

Adrian.
